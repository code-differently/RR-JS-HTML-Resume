    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p class="nottime">My objective is to translate and apply the skills I've acquired as a diligent educator, into a

        passionate focus on constant self improvement, by adapting to fit industry needs and evolving standards, and by
        facing all obstacles along the way with creative and abstract critical thinking until a solution is determined.
